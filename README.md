js-helpers
==========

Collection of js helper functions/methods built over time and experience from past work.

This git mainly serves as a warehouse of js stuff that I once built and seemed useful or likely to be reused. It's for personal use, so don't expect it to be well doc'ted. Most likely there'll be only //comments and guess-by-name :\

Feel free to take whatever helps you.
