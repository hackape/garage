Collection of stuffs built over time and experience from past work.

This git repo mainly serves as a warehouse of stuffs I once built and seemed useful, maybe also code that I copy-paste from someone else. It's for personal use, so don't expect it to be well doc. Most likely there'll be only //comments and guess-by-name :\

Feel free to take whatever helps you.
